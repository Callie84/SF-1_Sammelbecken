Are you ready to grow a strain that\u2019s a true meeting of legends, but in an easy-to-grow autoflower package? A plant that combines the massive yields of Critical + with the mind-expanding, euphoric power of the one and only Jack Herer? Then you&#8217;ve come to the right place. <a href=\"https:\/\/blimburnseeds.com\/critical-jack-auto\/\">Critical Jack Auto<\/a> is the ultimate hybrid for growers who want it all: quantity, quality, and a legendary high, all on a turbocharged schedule.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the plant you <strong>grow<\/strong> when you want a fast, reliable harvest of top-shelf, incredibly aromatic <strong>homegrown<\/strong> buds. It&#8217;s a favorite in our <strong>community<\/strong> for a reason. I\u2019m here to <strong>educate<\/strong> you and help you <strong>nurture<\/strong> this beautiful plant from a tiny seed into a truly epic harvest. Let&#8217;s get to it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-seed-to-a-massive-harvest-in-a-flash-the-full-grow-along\">From Seed to a Massive Harvest in a Flash: The Full Grow-Along<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The beauty of an autoflower is its speed and simplicity. You&#8217;re looking at a full cycle of just <strong>10-11 weeks<\/strong> from the day you plant the seed. Let&#8217;s break it down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-germination-the-first-spark-of-genius\">Germination: The First Spark of Genius<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every great plant starts with a single pop. The paper towel method is a can&#8217;t-miss technique.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Soak:<\/strong> Give your seeds a 12 to 24-hour soak in a glass of room-temperature water.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wrap:<\/strong> Place the hydrated seeds between two paper towels that are damp, but not dripping wet.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Keep it Warm &amp; Dark:<\/strong> Put your paper towel setup inside a Ziploc bag or between two plates.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sprout!:<\/strong> In 24-72 hours, a tiny white taproot will emerge. Game on!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CRUCIAL AUTOFLOWER TIP:<\/strong> To avoid stressing your plant, you should plant this germinated seed directly into its final pot. Autoflowers have a short, fixed lifespan, and they hate the shock of being transplanted. Give them their forever home from day one!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-entire-grow-cycle-the-beauty-of-auto\">The Entire Grow Cycle: The Beauty of &#8220;Auto&#8221;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where you&#8217;ll fall in love with autoflowers. There are no separate &#8220;veg&#8221; and &#8220;flower&#8221; stages for you to manage. The plant does it all on its own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Light Cycle:<\/strong> This is the best part. Set your lights to an <strong>18\/6 schedule<\/strong> (18 hours of light, 6 of darkness) and <strong>leave it that way for the entire 10-11 week cycle<\/strong>. That&#8217;s it! No flipping light schedules.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Nutrient Needs:<\/strong> Autos are smaller and faster than photoperiod plants, so they need less food.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Weeks 1-3:<\/strong> Your soil will have enough food for the first couple of weeks. You can introduce a very light &#8220;grow&#8221; nutrient solution around week 3.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Weeks 4-11:<\/strong> As soon as you see the first little white hairs (pistils) forming, it&#8217;s time to switch to a &#8220;bloom&#8221; fertilizer with more Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) to fuel bud growth.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Watering:<\/strong> Don&#8217;t kill it with kindness! Overwatering is the #1 mistake with autos. Let the top inch or two of the soil get dry before you water again.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-location-location-location-where-to-grow-this-legend\">Location, Location, Location: Where to Grow This Legend<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Critical Jack Auto is a versatile plant that shines in almost any environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Growing Indoors<\/strong> Its small size makes it a champion for indoor growers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Height:<\/strong> This is a short, compact, and bushy plant. It will typically finish at a very manageable <strong>1.6 to 3.3 feet (50-100 cm)<\/strong>. It&#8217;s PERFECT for grow tents or any grow with limited vertical space.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Environment:<\/strong> Aim for a stable temperature between 68-79\u00b0F (20-26\u00b0C) and keep humidity between 40-50%. A small fan for air circulation is always a good idea.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Growing Outdoors<\/strong> The speed and resilience of this auto make it a fantastic outdoor choice.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"701\" src=\"https:\/\/blimburnseeds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/Critical-Jack-Auto-cannabis-bud-with-orange-pistils-1024x701.webp\" alt=\"A Critical Jack Auto bud, displaying trichomes and vibrant pistils, highlighting its potency and aromatic terpene profile.\" class=\"wp-image-518857\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blimburnseeds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/Critical-Jack-Auto-cannabis-bud-with-orange-pistils-1024x701.webp 1024w, https:\/\/blimburnseeds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/Critical-Jack-Auto-cannabis-bud-with-orange-pistils-300x205.webp 300w, https:\/\/blimburnseeds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/Critical-Jack-Auto-cannabis-bud-with-orange-pistils-768x525.webp 768w, https:\/\/blimburnseeds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/Critical-Jack-Auto-cannabis-bud-with-orange-pistils-60x41.webp 60w, https:\/\/blimburnseeds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/Critical-Jack-Auto-cannabis-bud-with-orange-pistils-110x75.webp 110w, https:\/\/blimburnseeds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/Critical-Jack-Auto-cannabis-bud-with-orange-pistils-600x411.webp 600w, https:\/\/blimburnseeds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/Critical-Jack-Auto-cannabis-bud-with-orange-pistils-500x342.webp 500w, https:\/\/blimburnseeds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/Critical-Jack-Auto-cannabis-bud-with-orange-pistils.webp 1216w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Multiple Harvests:<\/strong> In warmer climates, you can easily get two full harvests in a single outdoor season!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best U.S. Cities and Climates:<\/strong> This strain loves warm, sunny weather.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>California (San Diego):<\/strong> The Mediterranean climate is ideal, allowing for multiple grow cycles.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Texas (Austin):<\/strong> The long, hot growing season is fantastic for autoflowers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Colorado (Denver):<\/strong> The intense sun will boost resin production, and the dry air helps prevent mold.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pro-level-playbook-advanced-tips-amp-using-your-trim\">Pro-Level Playbook: Advanced Tips &amp; Using Your Trim<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-quick-word-on-cloning-autoflowers\">A Quick Word on Cloning Autoflowers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a key piece of knowledge for any grower in our <strong>community<\/strong>: <strong>You should not clone autoflowers.<\/strong> An autoflower&#8217;s life is on a timer that starts the moment the seed germinates. A clone is genetically the same age as its mother plant. This means it will start to flower almost immediately after it roots, resulting in a tiny, sad-looking plant. For a fresh crop, always start with a new, high-quality seed. That&#8217;s how we <strong>innovate<\/strong> our gardens!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-common-mistakes-to-avoid-with-autos\">Common Mistakes to Avoid with Autos<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Overwatering:<\/strong> Their root systems are smaller; they don&#8217;t need to be watered as often as bigger plants.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Overfeeding:<\/strong> Always start with a half or even a quarter dose of the recommended nutrients. You can always add more, but you can&#8217;t take it away.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>High-Stress Training (HST):<\/strong> Don&#8217;t top or aggressively prune your autos. Their short life doesn&#8217;t give them time to recover from high-stress events. Stick to gentle <strong>Low-Stress Training (LST)<\/strong> only.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-to-do-with-your-trim-make-a-masterpiece\">What to Do With Your Trim?

Get a magnifying glass and check the trichomes on the buds. When they are mostly cloudy\/milky with a few starting to turn amber, you&#8217;ve hit peak potency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>The Chop:<\/strong> Cut the plant down and trim away the large fan leaves.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The Slow Dry:<\/strong> Hang the plant or individual branches in a dark room with good airflow and humidity around 45-55%. This usually takes 7-14 days.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The Cure:<\/strong> This is the most important part for flavor! Trim the buds and place them in airtight glass jars. &#8220;Burp&#8221; the jars daily for the first couple of weeks. A proper cure will make your buds smooth, flavorful, and even more potent.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-frequently-asked-questions\">Frequently Asked Questions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-does-auto-really-mean-for-me-as-a-grower-nbsp\"><strong>What does &#8220;Auto&#8221; really mean for me as a grower?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It means simplicity and speed! An autoflower doesn&#8217;t need you to change the light schedule to start making buds. It does it automatically based on its age. This makes it perfect for beginners or anyone who wants a less hands-on growing experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-are-the-effects-of-critical-jack-auto-like-nbsp\"><strong>What are the effects of Critical Jack Auto like?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a beautifully balanced hybrid. It starts with a happy, euphoric, and uplifting cerebral rush that&#8217;s great for creativity and socializing. This is followed by a soothing and relaxing body high that melts away stress without being a total knockout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-is-this-a-good-strain-for-a-small-grow-tent-nbsp\"><strong>Is this a good strain for a small grow tent?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s one of the BEST. Its naturally short and compact stature means it will fit perfectly in almost any tent without you having to worry about it growing into your lights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-much-will-my-yield-be-if-it-s-so-small-and-fast-nbsp\"><strong>How much will my yield be if it&#8217;s so small and fast?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t underestimate it! For a plant that finishes so quickly, the yield is incredibly impressive. Its buds are dense and heavy. You&#8217;ll be very happy with your final weigh-in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-do-i-really-leave-the-lights-on-for-18-hours-a-day-the-whole-time-nbsp\"><strong>Do I really leave the lights on for 18 hours a day the whole time?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes! That&#8217;s the secret to getting a big yield from an auto. The long light schedule gives the plant the maximum amount of energy to grow as big as possible in its short life. Just set your timer once and you&#8217;re good to go!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What&#8217;s up, fellow cultivator!
