style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Policing the Plant: Social Media&#8217;s War on Cannabis<\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feel like your cannabis content is getting overlooked online? You\u2019re not imagining it. From controversial takedowns and shadow bans to evolving enforcement policies, this overview sheds light on the challenges and changes shaping online conversations about cannabis. Stay updated on the behind-the-scenes efforts of social media platforms as they navigate the delicate balance between regulation and free expression.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Social Media Shapes Our Views on Cannabis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media significantly influences how we view cannabis. Through <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/humboldtseedcompany\/posts\/pfbid0QNVYbAFavu662WNoHNGNgE6aTPX9CVLXWGwMfYkNaskLqifQbu9hFchBAF1ooYmql\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">posts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, reviews, and images, these platforms can promote either positive or negative perceptions, affecting public opinion and personal beliefs. Influencers and advertisements often sway opinions by emphasizing benefits or risks that may not be entirely accurate. As a result, social media can create misconceptions or normalize use, shaping both individual attitudes and policy views.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research indicates that social media potentially impacts teenagers\u2019 intentions to use cannabis. Pro-cannabis content tends to increase the desire to partake, while anti-cannabis posts tend to reduce it. A<\/span> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Health Communication<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> study<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">confirms this, stating: \u201cPro-cannabis messages were positively associated with cannabis use intentions, while anti-cannabis messages were negatively associated,\u201d emphasizing its role in influencing youth behavior.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A study of US adolescents aged 15 to 19 published by NCBI found that<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/31708374\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over 75% reported viewing cannabis-based marketing on social media,<\/span><\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">despite bans on direct advertising. Each social media platform raised the likelihood of cannabis use over the past year, with exposure on Instagram nearly doubling usage odds. Overall, the study reported 94.6% of respondents encountered some form of cannabis marketing, and 73.1% saw it on social media platforms.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Takedowns and Content Removal<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the increase in legalization, most social media platforms still enforce strict bans on cannabis-related content. Common reasons for removing posts include promoting the sale of cannabis, showing usage or paraphernalia, and using hashtags or captions that encourage consumption. Additionally, reviews that contain purchase links are often scrutinized, making it difficult for businesses to connect with their audience in a regulated digital environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/thehumboldtseedcompany\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram<\/a> and Facebook (Meta) are leading the attack on strict enforcement, often flagging educational or harm-reduction posts. At the same time, TikTok demonstrates a zero tolerance policy, targeting any cannabis promotion, including coded language like \u201clettuce\u201d or \u201c420.\u201d In contrast, YouTube has become more lenient lately but still imposes demonetization <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on cannabis content, requiring it to be age-restricted and prohibiting promotion of use.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a Shadow Ban?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A shadow ban is a subtle restriction placed on a user&#8217;s content, preventing it from appearing in searches or feeds without their knowledge. This limits your exposure to certain posts, making it harder for creators to connect with their audience. Many report that their posts are not appearing in hashtags, their account discovery is suppressed, and they experience a sudden drop in followers, which diminishes their visibility and engagement on platforms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, most social media platforms don&#8217;t openly admit to shadow-banning. Still, evidence suggests that algorithms often lower the visibility of content flagged for \u201csensitive\u201d keywords or images, resulting in reduced exposure. Using cannabis-related flagged hashtags, such as those listed below, can unfortunately trigger restrictive measures on social media platforms.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cannabis<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marijuana<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weed<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">420<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cannabiscommunity<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weedporn<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">THC<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cannabisculture<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marijuanamovement<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ganja<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Receiving repeated community guideline warnings, even if posts are removed, can also lead to significant consequences. Such warnings may result in content being hidden from users altogether, creating substantial challenges for individuals and organizations seeking to increase their online visibility. This process can hinder engagement, limit audience reach, and impede growth, ultimately affecting the effectiveness of their communication strategies.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Censorship of Medical &amp; Educational Content<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The censorship of medical and educational content on social media platforms remains a significant and ongoing issue. Many personal testimonials regarding the use of medical cannabis, which advocate for its legalization or summarize scientific research, often face challenges such as being removed or shadowbanned by platform moderators due to strict content policies and ongoing regulations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram and TikTok have strict policies that often fail to differentiate between responsible medical discussions and recreational promotion. This restricts the spread of evidence-based knowledge about cannabis\u2019s therapeutic benefits, hampering people\u2019s freedom to learn. As a result, public perception is shaped by limited, often biased information, emphasizing the need for more nuanced moderation that supports educational content without censorship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to TikTok, they enforce strict rules against the trade and display of all regulated substances without distinguishing between recreational or medicinal types. The platform does not allow showing, possessing, or using these substances, especially among young users, due to the increased risk of harm. Adults can make personal choices, but<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/community-guidelines\/en\/regulated-commercial-activities\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TikTok&#8217;s policies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> focus on safety by banning the promotion or depiction of any \u201cdrug use\u201d in all forms.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coded Language &amp; Workarounds<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content creators often employ a variety of sophisticated strategies to circumvent restrictions on content related to controversial or regulated subjects, such as cannabis. They frequently resort to using coded language, which includes the use of emojis such as \ud83c\udf41, \ud83c\udf3f, and \ud83d\udd25 to symbolize or hint at the subject without explicitly mentioning it. In addition, they manipulate spelling by altering words, using forms like \u201cw**d\u201d or \u201cc@nnabis\u201d to evade automated filters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A study published on The National Library of Medicine examined how <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC8074195\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">strategies such as memes, hashtags, and lifestyle themes are normalizing cannabis use<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> despite restrictions. For example, 94.6% of respondents saw cannabis-based marketing in the past year, which nearly doubled the odds of consumption. This indicates social media&#8217;s strong influence, with each platform hosting cannabis content increasing the odds of consumption by 1.48 times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visual censorship is also common, and creators may blur images of products or obscure smoke in videos to prevent detection. Moreover, many use cryptic slang and region-specific code words that are familiar within tight-knit communities but less likely to be flagged by moderation systems. Despite these measures, the ever-evolving AI tools are effective at identifying such disguised content, making it a constant game of cat and mouse for creators.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advertising Restrictions are Getting Stricter<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to BioMed Central, as of December 2022, all seven major social media platforms have implemented explicit policies that strictly<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/substanceabusepolicy.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13011-023-00546-x?\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> prohibit the use of paid advertisements promoting cannabis<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These reflect the platforms&#8217; commitment to adhering to legal regulations and maintaining a responsible advertising environment. This move is part of broader efforts to regulate cannabis-related content and ensure compliance with evolving legal regulations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ban even includes hemp-derived cannabinoids like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greenstate.com\/explained\/what-is-delta-8-thc-everything-you-need-to-know\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delta-8<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cannatechtoday.com\/thc-oh-the-new-cannabinoid-causing-a-stir\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">THC-O<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which are prohibited. Even CBD promotions face restrictions, often requiring clear verification and adherence to local law and regulations. While Google and Meta permit limited CBD advertising, they enforce strict verification and geo-targeting, making it hard for brands to effectively reach their target audience and navigate the complex online marketing landscape.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cannabis brands are overcoming online restrictions by leveraging social media creatively, utilizing organic content and community engagement instead of traditional paid ads. They often produce educational posts and videos that add value while staying compliant with platform policies. Influencer partnerships help reach audiences authentically. Additionally, investing in SEO and marketing directs traffic to their websites without relying on advertising.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fight Back &#8211; What Can You Do<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the face of the social media war on cannabis, take control of your audience by utilizing email lists and websites. Building a direct line of communication keeps your followers informed and engaged, allowing you to share updates and information without relying on volatile social media platforms. This approach empowers you to cultivate a community that is less dependent on external platforms, which may impose restrictions on cannabis content.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cross-posting on cannabis-friendly platforms such as Leafwire, CannaBuzz, or Discord can also help mitigate the impact of social media bans. These platforms provide an environment for cannabis creators, free from the fear of censorship. By diversifying your content distribution channels, you can reach a broader audience that shares a passion for cannabis culture and supports one another in promoting knowledge about cannabis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, educating your followers on accessing your content in the event of an account ban. Inform followers about alternative platforms where they can find your work, and emphasize the importance of staying connected. Exploring new decentralized options, such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mastodon.social\/explore\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mastodon<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nostr.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nostr<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, offers exciting new possibilities for cannabis creators seeking safe spaces free from censorship, which supports cannabis advocacy and culture.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Final Reflections on Social Media and Cannabis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The intricate connection between social media and cannabis use illustrates how social media can shape perceptions and trends surrounding cannabis use. Although they can boost awareness and offer educational content, they also carry risks by spreading misinformation. Recognizing this dynamic is crucial for effective communication, regulation, and community support, thereby maximizing the benefits of social media platforms.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box fusion-builder-row-3 fusion-flex-container nonhundred-percent-fullwidth
