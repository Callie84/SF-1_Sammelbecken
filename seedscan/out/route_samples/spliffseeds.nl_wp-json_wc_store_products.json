A long flowering time. This pure sativa will is tall and require lots of maintenance. Well recommended for sativa lovers who miss the powerful effects of the original Haze.<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We wanted to make a feminized version to honour the Dutch legend Neville Schoenmakers, and are extremely proud of the results. Neville\u2019s Haze will grow at a fast pace, with long, thin fan leaves and a wide internodal spacing. Plant training may be beneficial, such as tying down or topping to help control the final height.<\/p>\n<p>Flowering time will be long depending on the phenotype. The buds will have an elongated structure that grows all the way up the branches. Neville\u2019s Haze cannabis seeds will have an aggressively fast growth and lanky sativa structure.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to high levels of Limonene, Myrcene and Pinene, expect a mixture of floral, citrus, lime, earthy and herbal aromas and flavours. The effect can be described as a soaring cerebral high, causing high energy, clarity, and a feel good factor that is perfect for morning and daytimes, but may keep you awake late at night.<\/p>","on_sale":false,"prices":{"price":"3250","regular_price":"3250","sale_price":"3250","price_range":null,"currency_code":"EUR","currency_symbol":"\u20ac","currency_minor_unit":2,"currency_decimal_separator":".","currency_thousand_separator":",","currency_prefix":"\u20ac","currency_suffix":""},"price_html":"<span class=\"woocommerce-Price-amount amount\"><span class=\"woocommerce-Price-currencySymbol\">&euro;<\/span>32.50<\/span>","average_rating":"5.00","review_count":0,"images":[{"id":142216,"src":"https:\/\/www.spliffseeds.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Neville-Haze-500x500-1.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.spliffseeds.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Neville-Haze-500x500-1-300x300.jpg","srcset":"https:\/\/www.spliffseeds.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Neville-Haze-500x500-1.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.spliffseeds.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Neville-Haze-500x500-1-480x480.jpg 480w","sizes":"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw","name":"Neville&#8217;s Haze","alt":"Neville's Haze Female Cannabis Seeds"}],"categories":[{"id":22,"name":"Female Seeds","slug":"female-seeds","link":"https:\/\/www.spliffseeds.nl\/product-category\/female-seeds\/"}],"tags":[],"brands":[],"attributes":[{"id":1,"name":"CBD","taxonomy":"pa_cbd","has_variations":false,"terms":[{"id":156,"name":"&lt;1%","slug":"1"}]},{"id":2,"name":"Difficulty","taxonomy":"pa_difficulty","has_variations":false,"terms":[{"id":161,"name":"Difficult","slug":"difficult"}]},{"id":3,"name":"Effect","taxonomy":"pa_effect","has_variations":false,"terms":[{"id":170,"name":"Euphoric","slug":"euphoric"},{"id":178,"name":"Uplifting","slug":"uplifting"}]},{"id":4,"name":"Flowering Time","taxonomy":"pa_flowering-time","has_variations":false,"terms":[{"id":182,"name":"10 weeks","slug":"10-weeks"},{"id":183,"name":"11 weeks","slug":"11-weeks"},{"id":184,"name":"12 weeks","slug":"12-weeks"},{"id":185,"name":"13 weeks","slug":"13-weeks"},{"id":186,"name":"14 weeks","slug":"14-weeks"}]},{"id":5,"name":"Harvest Month","taxonomy":"pa_harvest-month","has_variations":false,"terms":[{"id":191,"name":"November","slug":"november"}]},{"id":8,"name":"Plant Height","taxonomy":"pa_plant-height","has_variations":false,"terms":[{"id":202,"name":"Tall &gt;180cm","slug":"tall-180cm"}]},{"id":13,"name":"Seed Type","taxonomy":"pa_seed-type","has_variations":false,"terms":[{"id":231,"name":"Female Photoperiod","slug":"female-photoperiod"}]},{"id":6,"name":"Indica-Sativa","taxonomy":"pa_indica-sativa","has_variations":false,"terms":[{"id":196,"name":"Sativa","slug":"sativa"}]},{"id":9,"name":"Suited For","taxonomy":"pa_suited-for","has_variations":false,"terms":[{"id":203,"name":"Indoor &amp; Outdoor","slug":"indoor-outdoor"}]},{"id":7,"name":"Outdoor Grow Zone","taxonomy":"pa_outdoor-grow-zone","has_variations":false,"terms":[{"id":199,"name":"Zone C","slug":"zone-c"}]},{"id":10,"name":"Taste","taxonomy":"pa_taste","has_variations":false,"terms":[{"id":209,"name":"Earthy","slug":"earthy"},{"id":220,"name":"Spicey","slug":"spicey"},{"id":223,"name":"Woody","slug":"woody"}]},{"id":11,"name":"THC","taxonomy":"pa_thc","has_variations":false,"terms":[{"id":227,"name":"Extreme High &gt;15%","slug":"extreme-high-15"}]},{"id":12,"name":"Yield","taxonomy":"pa_yield","has_variations":false,"terms":[{"id":230,"name":"Very High &gt;500 gr\/m2","slug":"very-high-500-gr-m2"}]}],"variations":[],"grouped_products":[],"has_options":false,"is_purchasable":true,"is_in_stock":true,"is_on_backorder":false,"low_stock_remaining":null,"stock_availability":{"text":"","class":"in-stock"},"sold_individually":false,"add_to_cart":{"text":"Add to cart","description":"Add to cart: &ldquo;Neville&#8217;s Haze Female Cannabis Seeds&rdquo;","url":"\/wp-json\/wc\/store\/products?per_page=1&#038;add-to-cart=142117","single_text":"Add to cart","minimum":1,"maximum":9999,"multiple_of":1},"extensions":{}}]
