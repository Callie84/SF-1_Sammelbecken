Proper germination techniques help maximize the potential of your seeds, leading to vigorous growth and abundant yields. At Blimburn Seeds, we emphasize the importance of handling your seeds with care and following our recommended germination method to achieve optimal results.<\/p>\n<p>To begin, prepare your germination station by moistening two paper towels with room temperature water. Place one paper towel on a plate and evenly distribute the seeds, ensuring a gap of about 2 cm between them. Cover the seeds with the second moist paper towel, then cover everything with an opaque plate to create a warm, dark environment.<\/p>\n<p>Regular monitoring is crucial; check the moisture levels every 4-6 hours and adjust as needed. The germination process typically occurs within 24 to 120 hours, at which point the seeds will sprout tap roots. Transplant them into soil with roots facing down and maintain a moist environment to support initial growth. Consistent temperatures between 70-90\u00baF and using purified water with a balanced pH are recommended for best results.<\/p>\n<p>To qualify for our germination guarantee, document the process with photographs or videos, as adherence to these guidelines is necessary for any replacement claims. By following these steps, you&#8217;ll be on your way to growing healthy and robust Shortcut Auto plants.<\/p>\n<p>It is important to germinate your weed seeds carefully if you want to have a healthy harvest from day one. Although there are several methods to germinate our Feminized cannabis seeds, at Blimburn Seeds, we recommend our customers to follow our easy and simple technique. Before removing our Shortcut Auto strain from their packaging, remember that cannabis seeds are alive and delicate. Our hands are full of bacteria that can easily infect seeds and ruin our germination.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Set Up Your Germination Station:<\/strong> Begin by moistening two paper towels with room temperature water. Lay one paper towel on a plate and spread the seeds on it, spacing them about 2 cm apart. Place the second paper towel on top of the seeds, and make sure to remove any excess water from the plate. Cover the setup with another opaque plate and store it in a warm, dark location.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Monitoring:<\/strong> Make sure paper towels are still moist by checking every 4-6 hours and spraying room temperature water. Typically, germination should occur within 24 to 120 hours. Once the seeds have sprouted tap roots, plant them with the roots facing down and cover with about 2 cm of soil. Remember to water the soil regularly by spraying to keep it moist. It may take up to two weeks for the plants to start growing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ideal Conditions:<\/strong> Maintain a consistent temperature of 69.8 \u00baF \u2013 78.8 \u00baF (21 \u00baC \u2013 26 \u00baC) in the germination area. Use purified room temperature bottled water with a pH level between 5.5 and 6.5. Keep the seeds away from light, allowing exposure for less than 1 minute before and during germination. Avoid touching the seeds or applying pressure to them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Record Keeping:<\/strong> To qualify for the three month germination guarantee, it is necessary to follow all the steps outlined in our germination guidelines. Please do not use alternative germination methods, such as using a water bottle or planting directly into soil.
