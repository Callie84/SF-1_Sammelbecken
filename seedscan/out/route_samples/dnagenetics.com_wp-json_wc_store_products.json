Then get your hands on our mystery box <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DNA Mix Pack<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This pack gives you both regular and feminised seeds from a selection of DNA Genetics\u2019 award-winning strains.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You might get some couch-lock indica strains like Kushberry, or an uplifting, energising sativa like Cannalope Haze. Whatever they are, they\u2019re bound to turn heads.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Get the treasure chest <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DNA Mix Pack<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and experience the wonderful world of DNA Genetics\u2019 best strains.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>DNA Mix Pack origins<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DNA Mix Pack<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> contains a blend of our award-winning strains. It\u2019s made up of regular and feminised seeds that may be of an indica, sativa or hybrid genotype.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Regular seeds are adaptable to different conditions but have a 50% chance of developing males. That means they\u2019re ideal for experienced cultivators and breeders looking to experiment or create new strains.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On the other hand, feminised seeds are 99.9% likely to produce female plants bursting with buds. They\u2019re ideal for beginners and veterans alike. They\u2019re also photoperiod, meaning they rely on light cycles to reach and transition into the flowering phase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Indica strains originate from the South-Western regions of Asia. They adapted to harsh and arid conditions. You can recognise them by their business and broad leaves. Smoking their buds typically delivers relaxing, sleepy effects and may help relieve pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sativa strains come from hot, sunny and dry climates, including Southeast Asia, Africa and Central America. They typically grow tall with thin leaves. Puffing on their buds usually produces energising, uplifting effects and may reduce anxiety and depression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hybrids originate from breeding indicas and sativas together. They take on the best features of their parent strains. Expect a mix of flavours, aromas and effects, just like with the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DNA Mix Pack<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>A pack of sweet and sour delights<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DNA Mix Pack<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is a mystery box that may contain sativas, indicas and hybrids. That means the flavours and aromas vary depending on which award-winning strains you get.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You may receive a fruity indica like Purple Wreck. When you light up its dense buds, a burst of crushed grapes and berries fills your olfactory senses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Maybe you\u2019ll find a chocolatey sativa like Chocolope. Grind up its thick nugs to release earthy, nutty aromas. Light a joint of this strain and smell the creamy, coffee-like smoke.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>A variety pack of buzz and benefits<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DNA Mix Pack<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is a treasure trove of effects, ranging from calm and sleepy to uplifting and energising. It all depends on what strains you receive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Indica strains typically deliver a relaxing feeling that washes over your body after the first hit. As your buzz peaks, you\u2019re likely to reach a state of nirvana.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You\u2019ll turn into the cookie monster when the munchies kick in. As your buzz nears its end, you\u2019ll start feeling couch-locked and drift into a deep slumber.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Indica strains may produce analgesic effects, reduce nausea, and boost your appetite.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sativa strains usually have energising and euphoric effects associated with a cerebral buzz. After your first puff, you\u2019ll feel a burst of energy, readying you for the day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As your buzz peaks, you may feel inspired to create an artistic masterpiece. Waves of uplifting giddiness wash over you as it approaches its end. You\u2019re left with mental clarity once it\u2019s over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sativas may offer therapeutic benefits that boost your mood, reducing anxiety and depression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hybrid strains are more unique. Much like our <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DNA Mix Pack<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, they offer a mix of effects. You may get a buzz that starts by uplifting your mood and finishes by putting you to sleep. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">may even offer analgesic benefits and reduce anxiety simultaneously.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How to grow abundant yields from the DNA Mix Pack<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The difficulty level of growing seeds from the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DNA Mix Pack<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> largely depends on the strains. However, out of the regular and feminised options, the latter is typically the easiest to grow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Regular seeds are usually better for experienced growers. The main reason is that you have to stay vigilant for male plants. Even breeders need to identify and isolate them quickly, otherwise they\u2019ll pollinate your females.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Feminised seeds, on the other hand, are almost guaranteed to produce a field of female plants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since both regular and feminised seeds are photoperiod, cultivation requirements are similar. They\u2019ll need over 18 hours of light during veg and a shift to 12 hours to trigger the flowering phase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The key considerations for regular and feminised seeds lie in their genotype.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sativa seeds typically prefer hot climates with lots of sun and space. They may take longer to grow but don\u2019t require many feedings or much fertiliser. Their airy buds also reduce the risk of excess moisture and mould.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You must provide sativa strains with enough heat, humidity and light to get the most out of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Managing their height is also something you\u2019ll need to prioritise with indoor grows. Use the Screen Of Green (ScrOG) method to create a canopy, optimising space and yield for your buds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The short height of indicas makes them ideal for indoor grows because they require less space, resources and time. They also thrive outdoors thanks to their strong genetics. Their speed also helps cultivators avoid the first frost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Indica plants typically require topping and low-stress training (LST) techniques to manage their shape and light distribution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You\u2019ll need sufficient airflow and ventilation to prevent mould. Managing humidity and temperatures indoors also helps.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Erecting a shelter makes it easier to protect your plants from rainy and humid weather outdoors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DNA Mix Pack<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> contains various strains, meaning the expected yield also varies.
