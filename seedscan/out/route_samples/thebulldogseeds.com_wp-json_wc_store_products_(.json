It is named so because of its juicy nature with a nod to the iconic No.90 coffee shop and the method used to alert staff of police raids. Orange 90 is a hybrid of the past and the present with a fascinating history and a bright future.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"western\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a\">The Bulldog Orange<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a\">During the early days of the world&#8217;s first coffee shop, local authorities were less tolerant of coffee shops. As it is known, the Bulldog First was raided regularly by the police, sometimes daily.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a\">To alert colleagues of a police raid, the staff working on the first floor would send an orange as a warning down the serving hatch to their colleagues in the basement. The simple but clever trick gave the NO.90 staff the heads up countless times. The Bulldog Orange became a thing of legend, and there is an Orange by the side of a plaque that is displayed in The Bulldog First to this day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a\">Interestingly, the world&#8217;s first coffee shop is still regularly raided. However, these days, it&#8217;s by tourists with backpacks and not officers with batons.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"western\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a\">Orange 90: Heritage<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a\">Orange 90 is a mostly sativa cannabis hybrid and the perfect marriage between two cannabis strains known for their range of flavours and the potency of the flowers. Orange 90 is a cross of Purple Tangie and The Bulldog Cookies. The two top-class strains get along like a house on fire, creating a stunning hybrid that any grower would be proud to cultivate. Our team never gives up a chance to work with The Bulldog Cookies. It&#8217;s a unique plant that brings something different to the table each time it creates a new cannabis hybrid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/bt_bb_text][\/bt_bb_column][bt_bb_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243; width_lg=&#8221;1\/3&#8243; width_md=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; width_sm=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; width_xs=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; order=&#8221;0&#8243; lazy_load=&#8221;yes&#8221;][bt_bb_price_list title=&#8221;Wedding Cake&#8221; currency=&#8221;\u20ac&#8221; price=&#8221;23&#8243; price_text=&#8221;per seed&#8221; subtitle=&#8221;Smells and tastes like fresh peeled lemon slices&#8221; items=&#8221;+THC 18%<br \/>\n+Indoor 65-70 days<br \/>\n+Outdoor March\/November<br \/>\n+35% Indica<br \/>\n+65% Sativa<br \/>\n+150g Per Plant Outdoor<br \/>\n+500g\/m2 Indoor<br \/>\n+Earthy<br \/>\n+Spicy<br \/>\n+Wooden<br \/>\n+Citric Taste<br \/>\n+<i>The strain&#8217;s characteristics are based on perfect growing conditions, performed by professionals.

Don&#8217;t let the leaves distract you from the stunning flowers, though. They are compact, light green with hints of purple and more than a tinge of orange, looking as delicious as they taste.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"western\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a\">Performance<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a\">This plant takes after its cookie parent with performance. The Bulldog Cookies is a quality yielder, and Orange 90 performs on par with that. You can expect an average of 500 &#8211; 600 grams per square meter, your plants to grow between 120 &#8211; 170 cm, and to take 8 &#8211; 9 weeks to flower. This sativa hybrid should perform well in all conditions and can handle high humidity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"western\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a\">Growing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a\">Growing Orange 90 cannabis seeds is easy. The plants are well structured and uniform to the point they&#8217;re nearly predictable. They have an immense resistance to pests and diseases, a stress relief for growers. Orange 90 will take away your worry in more ways than one and will handle most environments, indoors or outdoors. Growers of all levels should consider this hybrid of two of the best cannabis strains on the market. It&#8217;s easy to grow qualities, and high-quality yield will satisfy the most demanding grower.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"western\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a\">Effect<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a\">The effect of this mostly sativa is more balanced than you&#8217;d expect from a sativa. The high is cerebral, though you should remain level-headed enough to do your daily tasks. At only 60% sativa, the high is not overwhelming. Overall, Orange 90 is a pleasant experience and perfect for those long afternoons in the sun or those slow mornings. And the best is yet to come.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"western\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a\">Taste and Aroma<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a\">TB&#8217;s 60% sativa is more orange than cream and tastes as it smells, like the most potent of oranges. The flavour is so sweet and sticky you&#8217;ll be licking your lips like you&#8217;ve eaten ice cream. There is a hint of cookies and gas to the taste, though it is mainly an afterthought long after the juiciness has left your taste buds. The aromas of fresh oranges will blow you away and have you dreaming about hot summer days and freshly squeezed orange juice.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"western\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a\">Orange 90 at TB Seeds<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a\">The Bulldog Seeds is home to Orange 90. A tribute to a Bulldog legend and the marriage of two world-class cannabis strains, this 60% sativa hybrid is a fine blend of sativa and indica. Any grower should consider cultivating it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a\">The Bulldog only works with the best genetics available, and we can&#8217;t wait to see what growers do with TB Seeds&#8217; version of this sure-to-be classic plant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a\">The Bulldog Orange is a part of Bulldog history.
